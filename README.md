# bestestNoteTaker

The bestest NoteTaker ever created!

## Description

This repository contains my solution for the Module 11 Challenge - "11 Express.js: Note Taker"

In order for my work to show what I can do, I used Node.js and the Express package to complete the following User Story and A/C:

User Story: \
AS A small business owner, I WANT to be able to write and save notes, SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

Acceptance Criteria: \
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears

## Usage

My final version of the work mirrors the UT Challenge source file/code, user story, acceptance criteria, and grading rubric.

## Credits

I usually credit Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck - however, I wrote all my own code without any impediments, on this one.

- <https://stackoverflow.com/>

- <https://www.taskade.com/>

- <https://google.com/>

- <https://bing.com/>

- <(https://claude.ai/new)> for troubleshooting and error handling, because I had a hard time getting my code to work



I referenced code from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my node.js application.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was able to deploy, but not without many issues.
