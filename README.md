The bestest NoteTaker ever created!

## Description

This repository contains my solution for the Module 9 Challenge - \
"09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator"

In order for my work to show what I can do, I used Node.js and the Inquirer package to complete the following User Story and A/C:

User Story: \
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

Acceptance Criteria: \
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

There is no deployed page, however, you can find my repository page here:

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

My final version of the work mirrors the UT Challenge source file/code, acceptance criteria, rubric, and video submission.

## Credits

I usually credit Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck - however, I wrote all my own code without any impediments, on this one. So I did not need his help whatsoever.

- <https://stackoverflow.com/>

- <https://www.taskade.com/>

- <https://google.com/>

- <https://bing.com/>

I referenced code from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my node.js application.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was able to deploy without issue and my code generated the necessary OUTPUTREADME.md.
